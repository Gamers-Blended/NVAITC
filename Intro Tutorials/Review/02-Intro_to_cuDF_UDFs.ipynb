    "cuDF’s DataFrame class has two primary methods that let users run custom Python functions on GPUs: `apply_rows` and `apply_chunks`. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to use `apply_rows` and `apply_chunks` to create your own UDFs and show how you can implement a GPU-accelerated windowing function. At the end, we'll also walk through a more advanced example of applying a user defined function on a grouped DataFrame (using `apply_grouped`).\n"

A kernel function is a function that will be executed on each row of the DataFrame set the output value for each row. **The execution order of rows is arbitrary, so each execution of the function MUST be independent of other execution.**\n",

    "As a result, the loop in the example function below resembles serial code, but executes in parallel in multiple threads on the GPU. When `kernel` is invoked, the function arguments corresponding to the input/output are strided so as to improve GPU parallelism.

    "In the section above, the data was generally split into single-element chunks. `apply_chunks` is a more general version of `apply_rows` that gives us control over how the data is chunked on the GPU. We can specify how to divide the long array, map each of the array chunks to different GPU blocks to process (using the `chunks` argument) and assign the number of threads per block (using the `tpb` argument).\n",

In this example below, with `chunks=16`, cuDF tries to uniformly cut the 1000 elements into chunks of size 16 spread across multiple blocks. Eight threads per block process the subarray of size 16, since we set `tpb=8`."

One of the most popular ways to process time series data is to compute a moving average, as if you were sliding a window across your array.
